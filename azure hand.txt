Azure service
-----------------------------

waht is cloud computing:
renting hardware istead buying is all about.

IAAS - Infra as service
gives u full control over infra sources e.g virtual machine/storage etc.
you must take care of all the admin tasks such as upgrades, backup, patching etc
per-per-use, EC2, VM, GCE

PAAS:
Give runtime env/platform to deploy application and development tools
azure take care of all the admin tasks including automated backups
Pay per service model

SAAS:
give app access to end users
azure takes care of all admin tasks
pay per subscription model.

---
learn shared responsiblity model

-----

pub cloud - resouces are shared among multiple users and users pay of resources they use
AWS, GCP, Azure

private cloud - resources not shared with other orgs, high security
private data center


hybrid - public, private both in an interconnected env.

---
features of pub cloud:

high avialablity and fault tolrence (load balancing)
scalablity - ability to adjust according to demand ( learn vertical scaling and horizontal scaling)
elasticty - system scale up and down bsed on demand
cost effectiveness 

----------------
azure account --- subscription ---- resource groups --- resources

one resouce can only be part of one resource group

---------------------------
learn what is cloud shell

---------
create a virtual machine

search virtual machine, then create resouce group, other fileds, sizes, ports ( 22 should be allowed as it is ssh)


learn avialablity zone -- group of datacenter

what all things are required to create a vm

-----------------------


VM Scale set

learn scale in and scale out


go to azure portal and search vms

and same thing u did to provision vm.
then count of vm, scaling policy

scale out etc etc


fault domain - physical servers rack
update domain - learn

-----------------
azure virtual desktop
type of managed virtual machine that enables multiple users to access virtual desktops and app from anywhere any device

-----------
diff btw azure virtual desktop and vm
--------------

what is virtualization. -- multiple os system on same machine

waht is virtual machine:
what are containers
-----------------------

azure container instances:

azure container registry:

then networking, advanced, tags

then once running we can connect to container, ssh etc.

---------------

Azure functions:

Event driven
serverless
compute


Cosr effective, pay for no. of execution
faster
scalable
flexible


creating a function:
click create on function app, publish, runtime stack etc

plan type serverless


learn complete function
-----------------

azure app services:

- it is platform as a services
to build and host applicaiton of any progamming lamguage

web apps using azure web apps
background jobs using azure web jobs
mobile backends using mobile apps
restful apis using API apps

supports scaling and high avialablity

supports linux and windows

microsoft focuses on infra


-----------
web apps: full support of hosting web apps
python, php, ruby, java, asp etc

api apps: 
rest based web apis by using choice of language

web jobs
similar to cronjob -- can be scheduled

u can use to run a program


mobile apps:
build backend for ios/android

---------------------------------

learn deployment slots.

-----------------------------------

VNET peering
connects vnets from multiple regions
over private ip
traffic remains within microsoft networks



we have resources deyploed in vnet and also on on-premises network so to communicate between them
we use VPN
IPsec S2S VPN tunnel
P2S VPN channel

learn express route.

partner edge, ms egde

primary circuit, secondary circuit

faster speed, lower latency, higher bandwidth
---------------------

Azure DNS

buy domain for yealy fees from app service
Azure DNS can host ur domain
lets us manage ur dns domain

--------------
Learn BLOB storage
massive amount of large unstructed data ( any files ) can be stored into Binary large objects BLOBS

blob storage contains multiple blob containers

backup and restore data
storing files for distributed access
stream video and audio
storing data for analysis on on prem.
accessed over https etc
-------------------------------
Azure file storage
learn file shares and files.
instead containers we have file shares.
accessed by SMB, NFS protocol

enables u to create files shares in cloud and access these file shares from anywhere

SMB model learn


-------------------------------

azure queue storage
asyncornous processing

----------

semi structed data
storage account learn

-----------
azure migrate
azure database migration
azure data box

------
azcopy
azure storage explorer
