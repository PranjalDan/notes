Q1. Explain the difference between Azure App Service, AKS, and Azure Functions. 
When would you use each?

Answer:

Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for hosting web apps, REST APIs, and mobile backends. 
You don’t manage servers — you just deploy your code. Ideal for traditional web apps or APIs where you want to focus on code, not infrastructure.

AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) is a managed Kubernetes cluster for containerized workloads. 
You manage pods, deployments, and scaling policies but Microsoft handles the control plane. 
Best for microservices or apps requiring container orchestration and portability.

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service where you run small pieces of 
code (functions) triggered by events (HTTP request, queue message, blob upload). 
You pay per execution, no server management. Great for event-driven or background tasks.


Use case summary:
App Service → Web apps / APIs with minimal infra mgmt.
AKS → Complex, containerized, microservices.
Functions → Event-driven, serverless, pay-per-use workloads.


---------------------------------------------------

Q2. What are Azure Resource Groups and how do they relate to RBAC and ARM templates?

Answer:

Azure Resource Group (RG): A logical container for Azure resources (VMs, storage, VNets, etc.). 
Everything inside an RG shares the same lifecycle, permissions, and management scope. You can deploy, manage, or delete all resources in an RG together.

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Permissions in Azure are applied at different scopes — 
subscription, resource group, or resource. By assigning roles at the resource group level, all resources inside inherit those permissions. 
This is the most common way to delegate access.

ARM Templates: Azure Resource Manager templates are JSON files that define infrastructure declaratively. 
When you deploy an ARM template, you target a resource group. The template then provisions all resources into that RG.

In short: RG = container; RBAC = who can do what at that scope; ARM template = infrastructure definition deployed into RG.



----------------------------------------------------

Q3. How do you design for high availability in Azure (regions, availability zones, fault domains)?

Answer:
High availability in Azure means making sure your workloads stay up even if part of the infrastructure fails. You do it at multiple layers:

Regions: Deploy resources in two or more Azure regions (geo-redundancy) 
so if one region goes down, traffic can fail over to another. Use Traffic Manager/Front Door or load balancers for failover.

Availability Zones (AZs): Within a region, you can deploy your VMs or 
services across physically separate datacenters called AZs. This protects against datacenter-level failures. 
Many Azure PaaS services support zone redundancy automatically.

Availability Sets / Fault Domains: For IaaS VMs inside one region, place them in an Availability Set. 
Azure then distributes them across multiple fault domains (different racks/servers) and update domains (rolling updates). 
This protects against host or rack failures.

Load Balancers: Use Azure Load Balancer or Application Gateway to distribute traffic across instances.

Backups/DR: Combine HA with disaster recovery — e.g., Geo-redundant Storage (GRS) or Azure Site Recovery.

Summary:
Region level = disaster recovery.
Zone level = datacenter outage protection.
Availability Set/fault domain = host/rack outage protection.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q4. Compare Azure Storage types (Blob, File Share, Table, Queue). When do you pick each?

Answer:
Azure Storage gives you different services for different data patterns:

Blob Storage
Stores unstructured data like images, videos, backups, logs. 
Supports block blobs (general files), append blobs (log-like), and page blobs (random-access, e.g. VHDs). Access via HTTP/HTTPS or SDKs.
Use when: you need scalable object storage.

File Shares (Azure Files)
Fully managed SMB or NFS file shares in the cloud. Works like a network drive you can mount on Windows, Linux, or Azure VMs.
Use when: you need shared files accessible by multiple machines.

Table Storage
NoSQL key–value store. Stores large amounts of structured but non-relational data. Very cheap, highly scalable.
Use when: you need fast lookups of simple entities without joins.

Queue Storage
Message queue for decoupling components and asynchronous processing. Each message up to 64 KB.
Use when: you need reliable messaging between services.

Summary Table:

Service	Data Type	Typical Use
Blob	Unstructured/object	Media, backups, logs
File Share	Shared files over SMB/NFS	Lift-and-shift apps needing file shares
Table	Structured NoSQL	Metadata, IoT data, logs
Queue	Messaging	Asynchronous workflows


--------------------------------------------------------------------

Q5. Explain VNets, subnets, NSGs, and how to secure them.

Answer:

Virtual Network (VNet):
The fundamental building block of Azure networking. It’s a private, isolated network in the Azure cloud, like your own virtual data center. 
You can connect VNets to on-premises networks or other VNets.

Subnets:
Each VNet is divided into subnets to segment the address space and group resources logically. 
Each subnet gets its own range of IP addresses and its own security settings.

Network Security Groups (NSGs):
Act like virtual firewalls. You attach them to subnets or NICs to allow/deny inbound and outbound traffic 
based on rules (source, destination, port, protocol).

How to secure:

Place different tiers (web, app, DB) in separate subnets.

Apply NSGs with least-privilege rules at subnet or NIC level.

Use Azure Firewall or third-party appliances for centralized outbound control.

Use Private Endpoints or Service Endpoints to keep Azure services traffic inside your VNet.

Combine with Azure DDoS Protection for external exposure.

Summary:
VNet = private network,
Subnets = segmentation,
NSG = firewall rules,
Security = isolation + least privilege + Azure Firewall/Private endpoints.


----------------------------------------------------------

Q7. What’s Azure Key Vault, and how do you integrate secrets with apps or pipelines?

Answer:

Azure Key Vault:
A managed service to securely store and manage secrets, keys, and certificates. Microsoft handles the HSMs, encryption at rest, and access auditing.

Key Benefits:

Central place to store sensitive data instead of hard-coding it.

Fine-grained access control via RBAC and access policies.

Automatic key rotation, versioning, and auditing.

Integration with Apps:

Use Managed Identity of an Azure resource (VM, App Service, Function) so it can request a token from Azure AD and 
access Key Vault without any credentials stored in code.

Your application retrieves secrets at runtime via SDK/REST API or through Key Vault references in App Service settings.

Integration with Pipelines:

In Azure DevOps, you can link a Key Vault to a pipeline’s variable group. The pipeline fetches secrets at runtime.

In GitHub Actions, use Azure CLI or dedicated actions to retrieve secrets using a service principal or managed identity.

In short: Store secrets/keys centrally in Key Vault, use managed identity to access them, integrate directly with pipelines or 
application configuration — no secrets in code or YAML.


-----------------------------------------------------------


8. Describe Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and Log Analytics. How do you implement monitoring?

Answer:

Azure Monitor
The umbrella service for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry data (metrics, logs, alerts) 
from Azure resources, apps, and VMs. Think of it as the main monitoring platform.

Application Insights
A feature of Azure Monitor focused on application performance monitoring (APM). 
It tracks requests, dependencies, exceptions, page loads, and user behavior. 
You instrument your app with an SDK or enable it automatically for App Service.

Log Analytics
A workspace under Azure Monitor where all logs and telemetry are stored. 
You can run Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries to analyze data across multiple resources.

How to implement monitoring:

Create a Log Analytics Workspace in Azure Monitor.

Enable diagnostics/metrics for each Azure resource to send logs/metrics to that workspace.

For applications, enable or integrate Application Insights.

Configure alerts in Azure Monitor for metrics or log queries (CPU > 80%, error rate, etc.).

Use dashboards and workbooks to visualize the data.

Optionally route logs to storage or SIEM for retention/compliance.

In short:
Azure Monitor = full stack monitoring platform.
Application Insights = deep app-level performance monitoring.
Log Analytics = centralized log store & queries.
Implement by enabling diagnostics, linking to a workspace, setting alerts, and visualizing in dashboards.


-------------------------------------------------------------------


Q9. Managed Identities vs Service Principals

Answer:

Service Principal: Manually created identity in Azure AD; you manage its secret/cert. Used by apps/automation not running in Azure.

Managed Identity: Automatically managed identity tied to an Azure resource; no secrets to manage, Azure rotates them.

Access: Both get tokens from Azure AD; managed identity removes secret management.

In short:
Use Managed Identity for Azure-hosted resources (no secrets).
Use Service Principal for external automation.

Q10. ARM Templates vs Bicep vs Terraform

Answer:

ARM Templates: JSON, native to Azure, verbose.

Bicep: Simplified DSL over ARM templates, Microsoft’s new native IaC.

Terraform: Open-source, HCL syntax, multi-cloud, huge ecosystem.

In short:
ARM = old JSON,
Bicep = new Azure-native DSL,
Terraform = multi-cloud and most widely used.

Q11. Availability Sets vs Availability Zones

Answer:

Availability Sets: Spread VMs across racks inside one datacenter; protects against host/rack failures only.

Availability Zones: Spread resources across physically separate datacenters in a region; protects against full datacenter outage.

In short:
Sets = resilience inside one datacenter.
Zones = resilience across datacenters (higher SLA).

Q12. Azure Firewall vs NSGs

Answer:

NSG: Basic stateful filtering at subnet/NIC level. Free, simple.

Azure Firewall: Managed firewall with L3–L7 filtering, SNAT, threat intel, logging. Paid, centralized.

In short:
NSG = per-subnet basic rules.
Azure Firewall = enterprise-grade centralized firewall.

Q13. Azure Policy vs Blueprints

Answer:

Azure Policy: Enforce rules/standards at subscription/RG level (region restrictions, tag enforcement).

Blueprints: Bundle policies + role assignments + templates for repeatable landing zones.

In short:
Policy = single rule enforcement.
Blueprint = full package of rules + roles + templates


------------------------------------------------

Q1. Explain the Terraform workflow (init, plan, apply, destroy) and state file management.

Answer:

terraform init – Initializes the working directory, downloads providers/modules.

terraform plan – Shows what changes will be made without actually applying them.

terraform apply – Executes the plan and makes the changes in real infrastructure.

terraform destroy – Removes all managed resources.

State File: Terraform keeps a state file (local or remote) to track what it has already created. This state is critical for detecting changes and must be secured (store in Azure Storage backend with locks).

In short:
Init = setup,
Plan = preview,
Apply = deploy,
Destroy = tear down,
State = Terraform’s memory of your infra — secure it.

Q2. How do Terraform workspaces differ from separate state files?

Answer:

Workspaces let you use the same configuration to manage multiple environments (dev, test, prod) with separate state files under the hood.

With separate state files you manually create different backend files per environment.

Workspaces are simpler for small setups but in enterprises people often prefer separate backends or even separate repos for strict isolation.

In short:
Workspace = built-in multiple states in one directory.
Separate state files/backends = manual isolation but more control.

Q3. What are Terraform modules, and how do you structure them for large projects?

Answer:

A module is any set of Terraform resources in its own folder, optionally with variables.tf and outputs.tf.

You call modules from a root module using module "name" { source = "./path" }.

For large projects:

Create reusable modules for common patterns (VM, storage, network).

Keep root module minimal — just orchestrates module calls.

Version control your modules and pin versions.

In short:
Modules = reusable building blocks.
Root module calls child modules.
Keeps configs DRY and organized.

Q4. How do you handle sensitive variables in Terraform (like secrets)?

Answer:

Mark variables as sensitive = true in variables.tf so they’re not shown in CLI output.

Don’t hard-code secrets in .tf files; use environment variables, .tfvars in secure storage, or pipeline secret stores (Azure Key Vault).

Use Terraform’s integration with Key Vault or pass secrets at runtime through CI/CD.

In short:
Never hard-code.
Use secure variable storage + sensitive = true.
Fetch secrets from Key Vault or pipeline.

Q5. How would you implement conditional deployments or dynamic blocks?

Answer:

Conditional deployments: Use ternary expressions, e.g.
count = var.enabled ? 1 : 0 to deploy resource only if variable is true.

Dynamic blocks: Generate nested blocks dynamically (like multiple security rules) based on a list or map.

This makes your code flexible and avoids repetition.

In short:
Conditionals = count or for_each with expressions.
Dynamic blocks = loop over data to create repeated sub-blocks.


Q6. How do you manage Terraform backends (e.g., Azure Storage as backend)?

Answer:

By default Terraform keeps terraform.tfstate locally, which is risky for teams.

A backend stores the state file remotely and optionally enables state locking.

For Azure you use the azurerm backend: configure a storage account, container, and key for the state file.

Add a backend "azurerm" block inside terraform {}.

This allows multiple team members to share state safely and avoid conflicts.

In short:
Backend = remote state storage + locking.
Azure → store state in Storage Account.

Q7. How do you manage outputs and cross-module references in Terraform?

Answer:

Define outputs in a module with
output "name" { value = resource.attr }.

Call them in the root module using
module.module_name.output_name.

This allows one module to expose values (like subnet IDs) to another module.

Keep outputs minimal and meaningful; avoid exposing secrets if possible.

In short:
Outputs = module’s exported values.
Other modules consume them via module.module_name.output.

Q8. How would you integrate Terraform into a CI/CD pipeline?

Answer:

Store .tf files in Git repo.

Pipeline steps:

terraform fmt / validate for linting.

terraform init (backend + providers).

terraform plan and output the plan as an artifact.

Require approval for plan review.

terraform apply automatically after approval.

Use pipeline secrets/Key Vault for credentials.

Use a remote backend for consistent state.

In short:
Pipeline = validate → init → plan (review) → apply.
Store state remotely, inject secrets from Key Vault.

Q9. How do you handle Terraform state drift or locking issues?

Answer:

Drift: Resources changed outside Terraform. Run terraform plan to detect drift; apply to reconcile.

Locking: Remote backends (like Azure Storage with blob leases) prevent two applies at once. If a lock is stuck, manually release it in the backend.

Encourage team discipline: never modify infra manually; always via Terraform.

In short:
Plan detects drift.
Apply reconciles drift.
Remote backends + locks prevent concurrent changes.

Q10. How do you organize Terraform for multiple environments?

Answer:
Common patterns:

Workspaces: Single config, multiple states (dev/test/prod).

Directory per environment: Separate main.tf and backends per environment.

Separate repos: For strict isolation.

Use variable files (dev.tfvars, prod.tfvars) or environment-specific modules.

In short:
Workspaces for simple multi-env.
Separate folders/backends/repos for strict isolation.
Use tfvars for environment-specific values.

Q11. What is Terraform Cloud and when would you use it?

Answer:

Terraform Cloud is HashiCorp’s hosted service that runs Terraform for you.

Features: remote state, VCS integration, policy-as-code, cost estimation, approvals.

Use it when you don’t want to host your own backend or need team collaboration, governance, and audit built in.

In short:
Terraform Cloud = SaaS backend + runner + governance.
Good for team use without self-hosting.

Q1. How would you create a Resource Group and Storage Account using PowerShell?

Answer:

Install the Az PowerShell module: Install-Module Az -Scope CurrentUser.

Connect to Azure: Connect-AzAccount.

Create a Resource Group:
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "MyRG" -Location "EastUS".

Create a Storage Account:
New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "MyRG" -Name "mystorageacct123" -Location "EastUS" -SkuName Standard_LRS -Kind StorageV2.

In short:
Use New-AzResourceGroup and New-AzStorageAccount after Connect-AzAccount.

Q2. How would you automate post-deployment steps using Bash or Azure CLI?

Answer:

Use the Azure CLI in Bash scripts.

Example: After VM creation, run:
az vm run-command invoke -g MyRG -n MyVM --command-id RunShellScript --scripts "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nginx -y".

You can wrap multiple CLI calls in one Bash file and run it in pipelines or locally.

In short:
Wrap az CLI commands in Bash to automate post-deployment tasks; run commands on VMs with az vm run-command.

Q3. How do you structure scripts so they’re reusable across environments?

Answer:

Parameterize inputs (resource group, region, names) instead of hard-coding.

Use configuration files (.json or .env) to store environment values.

Keep functions modular; one script per logical task.

Output values (IDs, endpoints) clearly for chaining into other scripts/pipelines.

In short:
No hard-coding; parameterize, modularize, use config files; output results for reuse.

Q4. How would you pull a secret from Azure Key Vault in PowerShell?

Answer:

$secret = Get-AzKeyVaultSecret -VaultName "MyVault" -Name "DbPassword"
$secretValue = $secret.SecretValueText


Make sure your account or script has access policy or RBAC for the vault.

In short:
Use Get-AzKeyVaultSecret and ensure RBAC or access policy permission.

Q5. How can you use Managed Identity inside a script running on a VM?

Answer:

Enable System Assigned Managed Identity on the VM.

The VM gets a token endpoint at http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token.

In PowerShell or Bash, call the endpoint to get a token, then call Azure REST APIs with that token — no credentials stored.

Az CLI and Az PowerShell automatically use the managed identity if you run them on the VM.

In short:
Enable Managed Identity → VM gets token endpoint → script uses Az CLI or REST with that token → no secrets.

Q6. Example of a small PowerShell script to deploy multiple resources from a CSV

Answer:

Have a CSV like:

Name,Location,RG
mystorage1,EastUS,RG1
mystorage2,WestUS,RG2

Script:

$data = Import-Csv ".\storage.csv"
foreach ($item in $data) {
  New-AzStorageAccount -Name $item.Name -ResourceGroupName $item.RG -Location $item.Location -SkuName Standard_LRS -Kind StorageV2
}


In short:
Import-Csv → loop → create resources programmatically.

Known for stability, security, and flexibility.

In short:
Linux = stable, secure, open-source OS for servers and automation.

Q2. What are runlevels in Linux?

Answer:

Runlevels define system states (0–6) and what services start.

Example: 0 = halt, 1 = single-user, 3 = multi-user, 5 = GUI, 6 = reboot.

In short:
Runlevels = predefined system states with specific services.

Q3. What is the difference between Unix and Linux?

Answer:

Unix = proprietary, paid OS; Linux = open-source, free.

Linux has more distributions (RHEL, Ubuntu, CentOS).

In short:
Unix = paid; Linux = free, open-source, many distributions.

Q4. How do you check disk usage in Linux?

Q6. How do you check running processes?

Answer:

ps aux → list processes

top / htop → real-time monitoring

pgrep process_name → find process by name

In short:
ps = static snapshot; top/htop = live processes.

Q7. How do you kill a process?

Answer:

kill PID → graceful termination

kill -9 PID → force kill

In short:
kill = stop process; -9 = force stop.

Q8. Difference between soft link and hard link

Answer:

Soft link: pointer to file, can cross filesystems, broken if original deleted

Hard link: another name for same inode, same filesystem, survives deletion if other exists

In short:
Soft link = shortcut; Hard link = exact duplicate inode.

Q9. How do you check network interfaces?

Answer:

ip a or ifconfig → view interfaces and IPs

nmcli → manage network connections

In short:

Q11. How do you monitor logs in Linux?

Answer:

tail -f /var/log/messages → live log monitoring

journalctl -f → systemd logs

In short:
tail -f = monitor log files; journalctl = systemd logs.

Q12. How do you manage users?

Answer:

chgrp → change group

In short:
chmod = read/write/execute; chown = owner; chgrp = group.

Q14. Difference between process and thread

Answer:

Process: independent execution unit with separate memory

Thread: lightweight, shares memory with process

In short:
Process = independent; Thread = shared memory.

Q15. How do you check CPU usage?

Answer:

top or htop → interactive

mpstat -P ALL → per CPU stats

In short:
top = general CPU usage; mpstat = per CPU core.

Q16. How do you schedule jobs?

Answer:

Cron: recurring tasks (crontab -e)

At: one-time task (echo "command" | at time)

In short:
Cron = scheduled jobs; At = one-time execution.

Q17. How do you check services?

Answer:

systemctl status service → check service status

1. Difference between Azure AD roles and Azure resource roles

Azure AD roles: These control access to Azure Active Directory itself (users, groups, applications, identity settings). 
Example: A User Administrator can create and manage user accounts, but they don’t control virtual machines or storage.
Azure resource roles (RBAC): These apply to Azure resources (VMs, storage, databases, etc.). 
Example: A Contributor can manage a resource group (create/edit/delete resources) but can’t manage Azure AD identities.

👉 Think of it as: AD roles = identity management, Resource roles = resource management.

In-short:

AD roles → manage users/groups.
Resource roles → manage Azure services/resources.

2. What is Conditional Access in Azure AD?

Conditional Access adds an “if this, then that” rule for logins.
Example: If a user is signing in from an unknown location, require MFA (multi-factor authentication).
It helps balance security and productivity by only applying restrictions when needed.

In-short: Conditional Access = rules that control login based on conditions (location, device, risk, etc.).

3. What is Azure Security Center / Microsoft Defender for Cloud?

It’s a unified security management tool for Azure and hybrid environments.
It continuously scans resources for vulnerabilities, gives security recommendations, and can enforce compliance.
It also provides threat detection and integrates with Microsoft Defender to protect against attacks.

In-short: Defender for Cloud = monitors, protects, and improves security of your Azure and hybrid workloads.

4. What is a Service Principal? What are Managed Identities?

Service Principal: Like a “user identity” for applications or scripts. Instead of using your own username/password, the app uses a service principal to access resources securely.
Managed Identities: A special type of service principal created and managed by Azure automatically. You don’t need to handle secrets/passwords — Azure rotates credentials for you.

In-short:

Service Principal = identity for apps.
Managed Identity = service principal managed by Azure, no secrets needed.

5. How does Azure handle disaster recovery between regions?

Azure uses Region Pairs — each Azure region is paired with another region in the same geography (e.g., East US ↔ West US).
If one region goes down, services can failover to its pair.
You can also use services like Azure Site Recovery for replicating VMs and Geo-redundant Storage (GRS) for data.

In-short: Azure ensures DR by using paired regions + replication (Site Recovery, GRS).

6. How would you control costs in Azure?

Use Azure Cost Management to track and analyze usage.
Apply budgets and alerts to prevent overspending.
Use tags to identify which team/project is using resources.
Right-size resources (stop unused VMs, use reserved instances for long-term workloads).

In-short: Track (Cost Mgmt), Limit (Budgets), Organize (Tags), Optimize (Right-size).

7. Client asks: Improve Azure environment security – first 3 steps?

Identity security → Enforce MFA, Conditional Access, least privilege RBAC.
Data security → Store secrets in Key Vault, enable encryption at rest and in transit.
Monitoring & compliance → Enable Defender for Cloud, set up alerts, and apply policies.

In-short: Identity (MFA & RBAC) + Data (Key Vault, encryption) + Monitoring (Defender, alerts).

8. How would you migrate on-prem workloads to Azure?

First, assess current infrastructure using Azure Migrate.
Then, choose migration type:
Rehost (Lift & Shift) → Move VMs directly to Azure with minimal changes.
Refactor → Modify apps to use Azure services (like App Service).
Rebuild/Re-architect → Fully redesign using cloud-native (like Kubernetes).
Finally, test and optimize after migration.

In-short: Assess → Choose migration strategy (Lift & Shift, Refactor, Rebuild) → Test & optimize.

9. How would you integrate on-prem AD with Azure AD?

Use Azure AD Connect (a sync tool). It synchronizes on-prem users, groups, and passwords with Azure AD.
This allows hybrid identity: users can log in to cloud apps with the same username/password as on-prem.
You can also enable SSO (Single Sign-On) so users don’t need to re-enter credentials.

In-short: Integration = Azure AD Connect → sync identities + enable SSO.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Identity / Access

Q1. How would you design Azure AD for a company with multiple subsidiaries and different security policies?

Create a single Azure AD tenant if centralised identity is required, or multiple tenants if full separation is needed.
Use Administrative Units and Conditional Access policies to apply different rules to different groups/subsidiaries.
Use Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to grant time-bound admin access.

In-short: One tenant + Admin Units + Conditional Access + PIM for per-subsidiary security.

Q2. How would you rotate credentials or keys used by applications automatically?

Store all secrets/keys in Azure Key Vault.
Enable Key Vault Key Rotation (automatic rotation or Event Grid triggers).
For apps using Managed Identities, you avoid keys entirely.

In-short: Store secrets in Key Vault + enable automatic rotation or use Managed Identity to skip keys.

Q3. When would you choose Managed Identity over Service Principal?

If the app is running in Azure and supports Managed Identity → always prefer it.
No need to handle secrets; credentials rotate automatically.
Only use Service Principal if your app is outside Azure or Managed Identity not supported.

In-short: Use Managed Identity inside Azure; Service Principal for external apps.

Networking

Q4. Two VNets are in different regions and different subscriptions. How can you connect them securely and cost-effectively?

Use VNet peering across regions (“Global VNet Peering”) for high-speed, low-latency connectivity.
Or use a VPN Gateway for encrypted site-to-site tunnel if peering not possible.
Ensure proper RBAC permissions to set it up across subscriptions.

In-short: Global VNet Peering is fastest; VPN Gateway if encryption or isolation needed.

Q5. When would you use Private Link vs Service Endpoint?

Service Endpoint: Extends your VNet to Azure service over Microsoft backbone but service still has a public endpoint.
Private Link: Gives the service a private IP inside your VNet, completely eliminating public exposure.

In-short: Service Endpoint = secure path but still public address; Private Link = true private IP.

Q6. How do you secure communication between on-prem network and Azure VNet beyond just VPN Gateway?

Use ExpressRoute (private dedicated connection).
Combine with IPsec encryption if needed.
Enforce NSGs/Firewalls at both ends to restrict traffic.

In-short: ExpressRoute + NSG/Firewall = more secure than plain VPN.

Compute / App Hosting

Q7. You have a critical web application on Azure App Service. How would you make it highly available and zero-downtime during upgrades?

Enable App Service deployment slots (blue-green).
Scale across multiple instances and across regions using Traffic Manager/Front Door.
Use health checks and staged rollouts.

In-short: Deployment slots + multi-instance + regional failover.

Q8. VM Scale Sets vs AKS: when to use which?

VM Scale Sets: When you need scalable virtual machines (like backend workers).
AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service): When you want container orchestration and microservices.

In-short: Scale Sets for VMs; AKS for containers/microservices.

Q9. How do you patch a fleet of Azure VMs without downtime?

Use Azure Update Manager (previously Update Management).
Apply updates in maintenance windows with rolling reboots.

Or put VMs in Availability Sets to ensure at least one instance stays up.

In-short: Update Manager + rolling updates + Availability Sets.
Storage / Data

Q10. How would you protect sensitive data stored in Blob Storage from public access?

Disable public blob access at storage account level.
Use Private Endpoints to restrict access to your VNet.
Enforce RBAC or Shared Access Signatures (SAS) with expiry for access.

In-short: Disable public access + Private Endpoint + SAS/RBAC.

Q11. When do you choose Premium SSD vs Standard HDD?

Premium SSD: For production workloads needing high IOPS and low latency.
Standard HDD: For dev/test or infrequently accessed data.
In-short: Premium SSD = high performance; Standard HDD = cheap storage.

Q12. How can you replicate storage data across regions automatically?

Choose Geo-redundant Storage (GRS) or Read-access GRS (RA-GRS) when creating the account.
This replicates your data asynchronously to a paired region.

In-short: Use GRS/RA-GRS for automatic cross-region replication.
Monitoring & Security

Q13. You need to monitor thousands of resources in Azure and on-premises. How would you design the monitoring solution?

Centralize logs in Azure Monitor / Log Analytics workspace.
Use Application Insights for app performance.
Connect on-prem servers via Log Analytics agents.
Create dashboards and alerts.

In-short: Central Log Analytics workspace + agents + dashboards/alerts.

Q14. How do you detect and respond to a suspected security breach in an Azure subscription?

Use Microsoft Defender for Cloud to identify alerts.
Investigate via Azure Security Center recommendations & Azure Sentinel.
Isolate compromised resources, rotate credentials, apply patches.

In-short: Defender detects → Sentinel investigates → isolate & fix.

Q15. How do you ensure compliance with a standard (like ISO or HIPAA) in Azure?

Use Azure Policy to enforce compliance rules.
Use Compliance Manager and built-in blueprints for that standard.
Continuously review reports.

In-short: Azure Policy + Compliance Manager/Blueprints.

Cost & Governance

Q16. Your team keeps spinning up expensive test VMs. How would you control and automatically clean them up?

Apply tags (“Environment: Test”).
Set up Azure Policy or Automation Runbooks to auto-shut down/delete after X days.
Use budgets & alerts to notify overspending.

In-short: Tags + Auto-cleanup policy + Budgets.

Q17. How would you design a tagging strategy for large-scale Azure deployments?

Define a standard tag set (Owner, Environment, CostCenter, AppName).
Enforce via Azure Policy so resources without tags are denied or flagged.
Use tags for cost allocation and governance.

In-short: Standardize tags + enforce with Policy.

Q18. Explain Reserved Instances, Spot VMs, and Savings Plans — when would you use each?

Reserved Instances: Commit to 1- or 3-year VM usage for cheaper rates.
Spot VMs: Very low cost but can be evicted anytime — for non-critical or batch jobs.
Savings Plans: Flexible commitment across VM sizes for overall discount.

In-short: Reserved = steady workloads; Spot = cheap/interruptible; Savings Plan = flexible discount.

DevOps / IaC

Q19. Explain how you’d set up a full CI/CD pipeline for an app deploying to Azure.

Code in GitHub/Azure Repos.
CI: Build/test pipeline.
CD: Deploy to Azure App Service or AKS via Azure DevOps Pipelines or GitHub Actions.

Use approvals and slots for production.

In-short: Git + Pipeline (build/test) + Deploy to Azure with approvals.

Q20. How would you structure Terraform or Bicep modules for multiple environments?

Create reusable modules for each component (network, compute).
Use environment-specific variables/parameter files.
Keep state separate per environment.
In-short: Modules + variables per environment + separate state.

Q21. How do you roll back infrastructure changes in Azure if something goes wrong?

In Terraform: keep previous state & run terraform apply with old config.
In ARM/Bicep: keep previous template versions and re-deploy.
Use version control for IaC.

In-short: Version control templates & state → redeploy old version to roll back.

Scenario-based

Q22. A critical app is running in one region. Manager wants DR in another region with minimal cost — what do you propose?

Use Geo-redundant storage for data.
Keep infrastructure templates ready but deploy only on demand (cold DR).
Use Traffic Manager to failover if region down.

In-short: GRS for data + cold standby infra + Traffic Manager failover.

Q23. A client wants to move from AWS to Azure — how would you plan the migration?

Inventory & assess AWS workloads using Azure Migrate.
Map services (EC2 → Azure VM, S3 → Blob, etc.).
Choose migration method (lift & shift vs refactor).
Test, cutover, optimize.

In-short: Assess → Map services → Migrate/test → Cutover.

Q24. How would you design role-based access so that developers can deploy but not delete production resources?

Use built-in RBAC roles (like “Contributor” minus delete) or create custom roles.
Assign least privilege at the resource group level.
Combine with PIM for time-bound elevation.
In-short: Custom RBAC role with deploy rights only + least privilege + PIM.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1️⃣ Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)

Think of it like this:
You save a file in Azure Storage in Region A (say East US).
Azure automatically makes a second hidden copy of that file in a paired region (say West US) far away.
So if Region A has a big outage, the data still exists safely in Region B
GRS = copy to another region (for disaster recovery).
RA-GRS = same as above, but also lets you read the backup copy in the second region.

In short: Azure keeps an automatic backup copy of your storage in another region for safety.

2️⃣ How Peering is Done (VNet Peering)

Imagine you have two Azure virtual networks (VNets) — like two separate office LANs.
Peering is like making a direct private road between them so they can talk as if they’re one network.
How you do it:

Go to VNet1 → Peerings → Add peering → select VNet2.
In VNet2, also create a peering back to VNet1.
Allow traffic both ways if needed.
It’s instant — no VPN appliance, no internet.
For different regions, use Global VNet Peering (same steps).

In short: VNet peering = direct private connection between two VNets (fast, no VPN).

3️⃣ How to Secure Blob Storage

Blob storage is like a big public bucket by default — but you can lock it down easily:
Turn off public access at the storage account level (Azure Portal → Configuration → Public access = Disabled).
Use RBAC (role-based access) or Shared Access Signatures (SAS) with expiry to control who gets in.
For internal apps, use Private Endpoints so the storage account has a private IP inside your VNet (no internet).
Enable encryption (Azure does at rest automatically, you can use your own keys if needed).

In short: Disable public access + use RBAC/SAS for permissions + Private Endpoint for private IP + encryption on.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1️⃣ What is terraform taint and when would you use it?

terraform taint marks a resource in the state file as “tainted.”
Next time you run terraform apply, Terraform will destroy and recreate that resource.
Useful when a resource is corrupted or misbehaving but Terraform doesn’t detect any config change.

In-short:
terraform taint = force Terraform to recreate a resource on next apply.

2️⃣ Difference between local state and remote state
Feature	Local State	Remote State
Where stored	On your local machine as terraform.tfstate	In a backend (S3, Azure Storage, Terraform Cloud, etc.)
Collaboration	Not ideal — single person only	Multiple users can share
Security	Risk of losing or leaking	Can enable encryption, access control
Locking	Manual	Many backends support state locking

In-short:
Local = file on your laptop (not team-friendly); Remote = shared, secure, supports locking.

3️⃣ How do you handle dependencies between resources?

Terraform automatically infers dependencies if one resource references another (like using its ID).
If Terraform can’t infer it, use the depends_on argument to explicitly tell Terraform the order.

In-short:
Reference outputs to create implicit dependencies; use depends_on for explicit ones.

4️⃣ What is a data source in Terraform?

A data source lets you fetch information about existing infrastructure without creating it.

Example: data "azurerm_resource_group" "example" { name = "rg1" } — fetches details of an existing RG to use in your config.

In-short:
Data source = read-only information about existing resources.

5️⃣ How do you upgrade Terraform version safely?

Check the Terraform release notes for breaking changes.
Upgrade on a test environment first, run terraform init -upgrade.
Make sure all your providers and modules are compatible.
Keep Terraform code in version control so you can roll back.

In-short:
Read release notes → test upgrade in non-prod → terraform init -upgrade → verify apply plan.

6️⃣ How do you structure Terraform for multi-cloud?

Keep each cloud (Azure, AWS, GCP) in its own module or folder.
Use separate providers with aliases (provider "aws" { alias = "prod" }).
Keep separate state files/backends for each cloud.
Use variables for common patterns, but don’t mix one state across clouds.

In-short:
Separate modules and state per cloud; use provider aliases.

7️⃣ You changed a variable but Terraform shows no changes. Why?

The variable might not actually affect any resource property.
Or it’s only used in outputs or locals.
Or you changed the default in code but also passed a value from CLI or .tfvars, overriding it.

In-short:
Variable not used in resources or overridden elsewhere → no change in plan.

8️⃣ How would you migrate Terraform state from local to remote backend?

Add the backend block to your Terraform config (e.g., S3 or Azure Storage).
Run terraform init — Terraform will detect backend change and ask to migrate the state automatically.
Confirm to upload the state.

In-short:
Configure backend block → terraform init → approve migration.

9️⃣ Resource was deleted manually from the console. How would you fix Terraform state?

Run terraform plan — it will show the resource is missing and wants to create it.
If you want Terraform to recreate it, just run terraform apply.
If the resource was replaced manually and you want Terraform to adopt it, use terraform import to bring the real resource into the state.

In-short:
Missing resource: run plan/apply to recreate, or terraform import to sync existing one into state.
